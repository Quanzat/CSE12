# CSE 12 Style Formatter and JUnit import

* Open the `VSCode Formatter` Folder and copy the two file into the the `.vscode` Folder in the program. This should copy over the formatter for coding styles and any JUnit import to test for your code.

* NOTE: If you don't have the `.vscode` folder in your program, you can do
`COMMAND + SHIFT + P` then select `Java: Configure Classpath` and add in the JUnit path directory, which should create the `.vscode` folder.
